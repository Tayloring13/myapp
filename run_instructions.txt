ðŸ§© 1. Confirm What You Did to Make It Work

You basically ran two separate processes (and thatâ€™s what youâ€™ll want to repeat later).

Terminal #1 â†’ Run the server
& C:/Users/taylo/myapp-clean/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
python app/server.py


Once you saw:

Application startup complete.


you left that running.

Terminal #2 â†’ Send a voice query

Then you opened a new terminal, activated the venv again, and ran:

& C:/Users/taylo/myapp-clean/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
python test_voice_query.py


That sent the WAV file to the running server, got the OpenAI reply, and produced your ElevenLabs-voiced reply.wav.
